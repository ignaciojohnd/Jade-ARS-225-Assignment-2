# Jade-ARS-225-Assignment-2

This repository contains the images of my dataset and a spreadsheet describing the images.

Process Explanation
The pictures in my dataset were taken during my trip to Seattle and Alaska. They are various landscape and portrait photos of sights I found interesting or pretty. The locations in these pictures include: Seattle, Juneau, and Skagway. I then made each photo black and white to put more emphasis on detail and geometry rather than color.

Why This Collection
I picked out pictures that included both something manmade and natural. I wanted to emphasize the boundary between nature and humanity, the intersection between the two. We may not actively think about it in our day to day lives, but we must be aware of the beauty of the Earth, as we exist as part of it. I picked black and white to to set a timeless mood to the dataset.

Possible Outcomes
The outcome patterns would follow a similar pattern of a city/town with heavy natural elements such as plants, rock formations, and bodies of water. It is likely that the images will feature cars and people walking around to illustrate that these places are lived in by both people and nature. The images will most likely be in black and white just like the ones in the dataset.
